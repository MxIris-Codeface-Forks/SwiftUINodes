# SwiftUINodes

This repo is just a stub. It becomes relevant when [codeface.io](https://www.codeface.io) offers more graph layouts or graph-based visualizations. SwiftUINodes would become the link between SwiftUI and [SwiftNodes](https://github.com/codeface-io/SwiftNodes), being a toolbox for drawing graph layouts and typical graph-based UI elements like lines and arrows.
